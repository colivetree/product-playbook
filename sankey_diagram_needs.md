# Sankey Diagram of Needs - Flow Mapping

## Intro
This play uses a well known visualization mechanism (flow mapping) to create a helpful prioritization and visual communication tool that lets you see why certain activities will be higher leverage than others by aggregating solutions to a number of user needs shared by multiple customer segments.

## When to Run
When multiple independent solutions to a problem can be tested, when it's hard to understand and attribute conflicting views on the solution space to customer needs.

## Why to Run
Sometimes the hardest part about prioritising is merely to be able to make sense of the space and reduce entropy by converting a wide array of solutions into a consolidated way of tackling a user problem. The Sankey Diagram of Needs organizes the solution space by the number of problem it solves for its addressable customer segments.

## Roles
* Product Development Team

## How to Run
* 1) Map target user segments
* 2) Map main known user needs
* 3) Map solutions in play. They should be as independent as possible. In particular, if one possible solution contains another, the exercise's utility is voided.
* 4) Trace relationships between layers 1,2,3.
* 5) Focus on areas of highest leverage (from right to left), represented by highest flow.
