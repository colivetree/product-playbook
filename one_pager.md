# One Pager

## Intro
A one-pager is a well-known medium for creating shared context and articulating product vision in a simplified manner, outlining its key assumptions, goals and differentiating factors

## When to Run
When starting a new product you want to be able to clearly articulate its benefits and its potential in a very simple way. This helps rally others behind the vision and clarifies the premises it lies on, forcing you to examine your idea critically. If good design is as little design as possible, good documentation is as little documentation as possible.

## Why to Run
A powerful one-pager allows people to go from zero knowledge to a clear understanding of the problem it solves and its key assumptions in under 5 minutes. It's a conversation starter and an updated view of what the product needs to become.

## Roles
Product Manager / Author / Creator

## How to Run
1) Write the one-page using a format like the one in the resources below: [see here](https://github.com/colivetree/product-playbook/blob/master/one_pager_template.md) - Keep it down to one page only! The rest of the details can live in a longer brief or a six-pager.
2) Talk about it, open it up for comments, let people challenge it
3) Review, rinse, repeat
4) Share it regularly when people ask what you're working on and let it evolve as new information comes in
