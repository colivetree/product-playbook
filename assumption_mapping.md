# Assumption Mapping

## Intro
Every project starts with a set of assumptions. They do not always surface and not every team is able to call them out as such -u uncertainty is scary. However, clearly identifying and classifying them, helps guide your team through the naturally chaotic path of getting to a product delivery. Assumption Mapping is an exercise that forces you to state what you think as assumptions, grade them according to impact and certainty and then work to validate them starting with the most risky of them - getting into the habit of de-risking projects by delivering perceived value early and often.

## When to Run
At the beginning of a project, when introducing a particularly complex or risky feature, or even after brainstorming competing ideas.

## Why to Run
Forces teams to state their ideas as assumptions that need to be validated next to customers and other stakeholders. Creates a natural prioritization framework that looks at impact and uncertainty first. Sets the mood to align teams around their single riskiest assumption - one at a time.

## Roles
* Facilitator
* Team

## How to Run
1) Set the scene - create meaningful assumption categories / themes and provide examples. One split could be to categorize assumptions in terms of Desirability, Feasibility and Viability. Another split could look at these in terms of Desirability, Feasibility and Team Happiness. These should give you an idea of the types of example questions you should ask to prompt meaningful assumptions to arise.
2) Give your team 20-30 minutes to raise assumptions. Start with example questions and a couple of assumptions for each category and let them drive and discuss as they go along.
3) Identify any duplicate assumptions and cluster them.
4) Draw a chart with your spectrums of impact and certainty as two axis, forming 4 quadrants. One axis should go from least to most impactful, the other from completely certain to very uncertain.
5) Go through your assumptions, one at a time, and bring them into your chart where you and the team believe they should lie.
6) After the assumptions are raised, start with the most impactful and uncertain ones, then move [counter-clockwise](* [Printable Job Canvas](https://github.com/colivetree/product-playbook/raw/master/images/assumption-mapping.png)
). Devise actions to validate or invalidate them - your exercise is done, and your priorities have emerged in an organic form.
