# Product Kata, by Melissa Perri

## Intro
Inspired by the Toyota Kata, and its subsequent application in Kanban by Hakan Fross, the Product Kata, proposed by [Melissa Perri](http://melissaperri.com/) is a no-frills approach to product development, which gives teams a systematic approach to look at their daily activities to discover customer problems, hypothesise, test, learn and adapt (or Plan, Do, Check, Act) - all iterating towards a near-term goal (the Next Target Condition), a near-term next step towards the pursuit of a large-scale vision. It's a procedural framework that does not make any assumptions about the underlying agile methodology but keeps teams in focus and in flow, one goal at a time, while allowing them to pivot in a structured manner in case the current hypothesis is invalidated.

## When to Run
Most products spend the vast majority of their time in discovery mode, after uncovering a high-level problem, they work hard to understand the details, the jobs-to-be-done, what the solution would be and how to implement their version of it. The Product Kata is a very good way to state the goals, present the actions and align on the findings while doing product discovery at full steam.

## Why to Run
It provides teams with a methodology-agnostic way to discover the next steps, align on high-level goal and next small step towards it, while forcing teams to clearly outline their current status, obstacle, measure and expectations.

## Roles
* Product Manager
* Product Development Team

## How to Run
* 0: Set the **Direction**. This is the Company Goal, OKR, or other top-line metric we are looking to improve over a (potentially) long period of time. Example: Have a 1-click-checkout solution that improves conversion rate by 20%.
* 1: Understand the **Current Condition**. In a product development environment, this means understanding what users are doing at the time. Collecting these insights can be done through data collection, user interviews, usability testing, surveys and other feedback mechanisms. Example: Repeat customers now have to go through the whole form even though they've already filled in their details.
* 2: Define the **Next Target Condition**. Understanding your ideal end state allows you to target an intermediate stage that feels achievable and represents an improvement over your current condition. Example: We want to improve conversion for repeat users by 5%, by having their details available within the current checkout flow.
* 3: Define the **Obstacle**. This can be any internal or external factor preventing you from achieving your Next Target Condition or from making progress towards it. Example: We don't know if introducing a sign-up mechanism will affect conversion for first-time users.
* 4: Define the **Next Step**: Whatever the next action is that the team is going to take to overcome the obstacle. Example: Start asking for a password and introduce a registration button for first-time users.
* 5: Define the **Expected Outcome**: What we expect will happen once we perform the step. Example: We expect to maintain levels of form progression as the additional field will not constitute a barrier to completion.
* 6: Evaluate what we have **Learned**: This is what we have observed in face of our expected outcome. In this example: We have seen that we have introduced a 1% relative percentage drop in conversion for first-time users. We want to observe the effect of having saved details for returning users to understand whether this is effect is net positive.
* 7: Ask whether you've met the Target Condition. If not, repeat the process from #2.
