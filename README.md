A Playbook of Product Management Techniques

## Intro
A Product playbook is something I've wanted to do for a very long time.
Product management is an art, insofar as everything that requires human intervention to create something is art. But there is causality in what product people do, how the interactions between product managers, designers, developers and other stakeholders turn vision into usable objects or interfaces. This playbook aims to become a cooperative effort to describe the multiple ways one can turn insights and ideas into products.

The concept of having a playbook is inspired by sports and the best explanation I've seen is the one by Jon Lax in ["Great Products Don't Happen By Accident"](https://medium.com/great-products-dont-happen-by-accident/great-products-dont-happen-by-accident-f46323d8ad94)

The product playbook wants to give people plays they can apply to specific moments of the product development workflow. Each play should follow the same easily readable format and should be easy to pick-up and follow. Some of these plays originate from companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Intercom or Basecamp and used industry-wide, others have been developed by individual practitioners, tried and tested in the field and represented here.

Some of the companies that openly share how they develop product are:
* [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays)
* [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/books/product-management)
