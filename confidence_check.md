# Confidence Check

## Intro
A regular group exercise ran to assess the group's confidence in moving the work forward. Might be a design piece, an engineered feature or experiment, a new landing page or a prototype for user testing. In this exercise, the group compares the potencial impact and risk of its work with how confident they feel in moving it forward, laying out the next steps for each Work In Progress item.

## When to Run
The confidence check is a nice cross-disciplinary exercise to run every week (or fortnight) as it gives everyone a space to make shared decisions and commitments while keeping concerns and risks visible and actionable. 

## Why to Run
Teams often struggle to make decisions with joint buy-in. Ensuring there are regular get-togethers where work is discussed openly and where the impact and goals of the work are clearly laid out, where conversations can be had from an early stage and people's work process and progress happens in the open, and where a joint framework for moving work forward can be agreed upon.

## Roles
* Product Team

## How to Run
1) Conversation moves around the table, spotlight moving in turn to each member of the team
2) Each team member take 5-10mins to share what they've worked on last week, focusing on their latest explorations, what they've learned last week that led them there and what feedback they would need in order to make progress
3) The others voice their feedback in turn, offering feedback with a locus on: 1) how the solutions best connect to the goal, 2) what are the risks (business, user, technical) they see with each solution, 3) how confident they would be in shipping the solution now and why
4) the team decides what next steps they need to take next week to solve outstanding risks without which they can't ship
5) the team moves to the next team member
