# RICE Prioritisation

## Intro
Scoreboarding is not a one-size-fits-all prioritisation solution. There are natural risks associated with making decisions blindly, plainly on the merits of their quantitative merits. However, RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence and Effort), establishes the main dimensions upon which you can base product decisions.

## When to Run
When there are many competing priorities with no clear visibility as to how decisions are made. When there is shiny object syndrome. When you need to communicate decision making around the reasons behind the deprioritisation of a feature request.

## Why to Run
Teams often feel as though prioritisation is dark magic, arbitrary and flexible to HiPPO. Having a clear strategy to pit competing priorities against each other is often helpful in illustrating why a certain piece of work should be picked up vs another. While there is a grey area between similar RICE estimates, this framework gives you a sense of how much you'd be diverting from the most impactful items because of shiny objects appearing before you and competing for your team's attention.

## Roles
* Product Manager

## How to Run
* 1) Establish your metrics
** Reach - How many people will see this change and how often in the defined timeframe.
** Impact - What's the expected impact for those customers
** Confidence - How confident are we that we'll see the desired impact
** Effort - How much effort do we need to put into the solution to get live and verify its reach and impact.
* 2) Plot them on a scale with your highest and lowest priority items in opposite ends of the scale
* 3) For similarly scored items decide whether to prioritise risk or reward depending on the state of your product development. I.e. whether to give more weight to 1) reach and impact - rewards or 2) confidence and effort - risks.
