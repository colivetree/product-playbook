# Job Canvas

## Intro
The Job Canvas is a tool to align a team behind a high level job-to-be-done (JTBD). When that job is conceptually clear and can be defined, there are lots of moving parts required to execute on it for a customer. The Job Canvas is a visualisation and a framework to think about delivering a job to be done.

## When to Run
This play can be run when you need a tool to clarify the problem you're trying to solve with your team. It can be printed and placed next to the team, used digitally (it's easy to replicate in Trello, for example) or it can be used as a starting point for a project within a session with your team.

## Why to Run
It stimulates collaboration out in the open, and focuses on learning by delivering incremental value to customers. It stems from the need to deeply understand customer's motivation to hire your product for the job and gives the team constant visibility on the current state of play.

## Roles
-	Mandatory:
o	Session Facilitator (Product Manager)
o	Team Members

## How to Run

* 1. State the high-level JTBD. One of the ways to state it is to use Alan Klement's formulation of "When <[ A moment of frustration ]>, <[ how progress is visualized ]> so I can <[ how life is better ]>"
* 2. Gather some of the insights you have collected from your customers related to that JTBD. They can be moments of struggle, motivations, data that you've observed that proves or can potentially disprove. Place them in the insights column.
* 3. Define your hypotheses. They represent an assumption around what some of the smaller problems are and how they can be solved. A nice format for these can be found using the [Hypothesis Kit](http://experimentationhub.com/hypothesis-kit.html).
* 4. Define your measure of success. This is important to do at the beginning. Iterate only when you have either moved closer to your vision by achieving your near term goal or invalidated parts of your execution strategy changing what success should look like.
* 5. Draft your UX / your architecture. This section gives your team an understanding of what you believe your solution should look like. It can be a rough mock, a hi-fidelity prototype, a flow diagram or a system architecture. It should represent your current belief and should increase in fidelity and resolution over time.
* 6. Define your experiments. These can be qualitative or quantitative and you can create 3 spaces within with your current stack of riskiest assumption tests, your successes and your failures if you want to. The goal is to give you visibility into what you've done already to solve the job, what worked and what didn't and what you want to try next.
