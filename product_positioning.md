# Product Positioning

## Intro
Defining your product positioning allows you to clearly define what you're creating in opposition to an equally valid stance. It gives your team clarity in making decisions by clearly contrasting what your product is and what it could have been - a hard trade-off needs to be present in any defined position.

## When to Run
When starting a new product. When defining your unique value proposition. When conversations around the product experience are going in opposite directions. When your product feels bland / undifferentiated. When you need cross-team alignment.

## Why to Run
It creates a clear mental model of what the product is for everyone who is involved in building it. It helps you make clear prioritisation decisions and reject feature requests by knowing exactly where you stand. It can easily be represented in a scale.

## Roles
* Product Manager

## How to Run
* 1. Define each of your principles in 3 dimensions: More of, Less of, Explanation
** More about: "Destination recommendations"
** Less about: "Explicitly asking users where they want to go based on their budget"
** Explanation: "We want to capture users' intent from their interactions, without an explicit need to request information from them"
* 2. Chart your positioning on a scale/spectrum, establishing the gap between where you are and where you'd want to be.
* 3. Have your product positioning visible for your teams at all times
