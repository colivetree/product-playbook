# Critique

## Intro
A critique is a timeboxed process for teams to review work in progress with a format designed to get candid unbiased feedback by other specialists. You might run it with team members from different disciplines or bring in other specialists. If you want to get 

## When to Run
Typically focuses on work in its design stage, when any decisions the critique focuses on can still be challenged and the work reversed / fine-tuned. Do it too early (ideas and solutions not shaped enough) or too late (costly to change your project), and its effectiveness is dramatically reduced.

## Why to Run
A critique exposes flaws, biases, blindspots and fragilities in your process. These might be intentional or not, but bringing a set of voices that haven't been exposed to the design allows you to strengthen and stress test your designs before they are materialized in a way that's too difficult to reverse.

## Roles
* Presenter
* Audience / Feedback team
* Facilitator (optional)

## How to Run
One way to run a critique that ensures feedback is as just and direct as possible and that everyone's voice is to do as follow:
1) Assign the presenter with a timeslot (2-10mins depending on the complexity of the proposal)
2) Put their designs up where everyone can see them and be exposed to their critical features - a physical representation is ideal but not necessary
3) Encourage team members to take lots of notes while the presenter is going through their designs 
4) Once the presenter is finished give the team another 1-2mins to go through their notes and review the designs in silence
5) Everyone lays their notes out or attaches them to the design (e.g. post-its on a printed version)
6) Every team member gets a minute to go through their notes, explain the rationale guiding them and get the presenter's feedback
7) A summary of key takeaways based on shared notes is shared by the presenter or a facilitator
