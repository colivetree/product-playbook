# HEART - Goals Signals Metrics

## Intro
In 2001, a study by Normal and Nielsen looked at the impact of usability improvements in a company's bottom line. They used 4 key metrics. Satisfaction, Error Rate, Time to Task Completion and Success Rate. Today, these metrics are used in many shapes and forms by Internet Economy companies. The HEART framework bring user experience metrics into the heart of the goal setting exercise by teams, allowing them to look at their goals through a number of lenses that complement each other when creating delightful user experiences. Google has popularised the framework tying its customer-centric dimensions of analysis back to the kind of objectivity that makes engineering organisations tick with Goals, Signals and Metrics.

## When to Run
When setting goals for new initiatives or projects. When trying to avoid metric blindness and consider a range of user-centric perspectives. When setting high-level action plans for products.

## Why to Run
It's easy for Internet Economy companies to be trapped in local optima. They'll choose a metric and blindly optimise for it. They'll forget about the effect that certain profit-driven decisions might have on customer satisfaction or softer measures like trust, which can influence long-term retention. HEART brings attention to these perspectives and gets teams to consider these problems from all sorts of different angles.

## Roles
* Product, Design, Engineering Teams.

## How to Run
1) Look at your new product or feature and define what you want to achieve for each of these 5 dimensions:
* a) Happiness
** This is a qualitative measure that you could track with a survey. NPS is one way, questions around Satisfaction and Ease of Use are other tools at your disposal to proxy how happy people are when using your product.
* b) Engagement
** Engagement is largely quantitative. You can measure engagement on the amount of times people visit, how often they come back, your ratio of DAUs/MAUs. The time people spent listening to music on your playlist app. It tells you you've taken hold of a bit of their lifes and are now embedding yourself into their routines.
* c) Adoption
** Adoption is how you proxy for growth. How many new people are interested in what you're building, are they upgrading to your next version or to your next pricing tier.
* d) Retention
** Will they come back for more, is one question and how frequently is another one that retention looks at. Retention metrics such as Xday retention, churn, renewals and repeat purchases are ways to assess your stickiness. Does a certain cohort of customers think of you as a necessary part of their life, or would they just as easily use your competitor?
* e) Task Completion
** Are you helping people make progress? What's the key job-to-be-done you're getting hired for. Follow people's success rates and you're following a good measure of your helpfulness. This might be an imperfect proxy in isolation, but alonside some of the other metrics, it makes for a very powerful tool.
2) Understand how could influence these. Define Goals, Signals and Metrics to help you track progress for *each dimension above*.
* x) Goals
** Say you're revamping your search functionality. You might be tempted to think of your adoption goal as - 10% more people using search on the website. This is a red flag. Look for customer progress. You could say your goal is: to make it easier for more people to find the right product through search.
* y) Signals
** Signals are actions that indicate you're on the right track. For the above, number of new users using search is a good signal. Returning customers adopting search for the first time is another one.
* z) Metrics
** Finally metrics turn your signals into numbers you can track on a dashboard. % of sessions with search usage could be one. % of new users tapping search box is another one. Share of search usage vs menu navigation could be a third. Measure for what you're looking to optimize.
