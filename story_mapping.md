# Story Mapping

## Intro
Story Mapping is an extremely common way for teams to group their features into themes / epics and to visualize which ones can and should be accomplished within a milestone.  

## When to Run
At the beginning of large, complex initiatives, where we know we'll need to break work down and get a better understanding of what we'll leave for latter stages and why. It is critical that teams run a story mapping as a goal-building exercise and a critical analysis of what they do and don't know. This should take from 2h to about a half-day to be effective, don't let it run over a day, even for massive complex projects where groups can tackle separate parts of the project.

## Why to Run
* Get a clearer understanding of what we think needs to be included in each milestone (v1/v2/v3, alpha/beta/live or now/next/later)
* Get a good idea of what risks are involved with each workstream and each story, lay out assumptions so they can be tackled based on their risk (see also [assumption mapping](https://github.com/colivetree/product-playbook/blob/master/assumption_mapping.md))

## Roles
* Product Manager
* Development Team
* UX Designer 
* Other Key Team Members

## How to Run
This is a fairly simple work breakdown exercise, where the most interesting insights come from how one can run it in a multidisciplinary manner and get the most actionable immediate feedback available, which will allow the team to move forward with the right level of confidence, executing on current unknowns.
0) Find a massive whiteboard, one you can glue post-its to, draw schematics and wireframes, brainstorm around ideas. Leave some room for the actual story map, where you'll need each high-level story group to be clustered under their theme / epic
1) If you haven't yet, map High Level Functionality - your stories - into Themes / Epics. These might be based on Functional Modules, Jobs-To-Be-Done, or another representation of user needs.  Choose a representation that makes sense for your team and doesn't leave all the functionality in one bucket. You can also do this later, from the bottom up, by finding related stories, clustering them and letting themes emerge from team discussion. 
2) Get all the stories you have up on your whiteboard. 
3) Draw a line that represents your first version, your MVP. This will help ground your first discussions around what is essential and key to solve your first hypotheses as your new product or feature set is brought to market.
4) Give people time to go through the stories and ask questions freely. You can do this in two ways: One, have someone read out and explain the user stories and let people gather notes in the form of questions, silently. Two: do it as a brainstorming exercise, with a facilitator attaching the most significant a) Questions and b) Assumptions to the stories. Going through the stories also allows everyone to identify dependencies.
5) Allow a group discussion to emerge around the Questions, turn them all into either Assumptions or directly into acceptance criteria into your stories. This will create a direct line between what you know, what you think you know, and what you have to assume in order to ship and why. This helps teams make informed trade-offs.
6) For everything non-critical / not included in your first stage, it's fine to leave room for uncertainty. You'll learn a ton while building out the first version, so not every question needs to be answered. It is however, recommended, that teams still make Questions and Assumptions explicit and visible, so they can be either be ironed out later or turned into [spikes](https://github.com/colivetree/product-playbook/blob/master/spikes.md) they can run to remove that uncertainty.
7) Draw new lines for subsequent milestones, add your stories to each and make sure they're marked as tentative. This is an exercise in transparency.
