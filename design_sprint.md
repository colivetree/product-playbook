# Design Sprint (Draft)

## Intro
The sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers.

## When to Run
When the teams needs to align around the main problem they’re solving and focus their efforts on the customer needs. This may happen when the team is starting a new project, deciding whether to build a new feature or hasn’t been able to produce a visible impact on the customers with their current work.

## Why to Run
This play allows us to go from hypothesis to prototype in 5 days, allowing you to test it with real users and collect feedback that will inform future development.

## Roles
-	Mandatory:
o	Facilitator
o	Decider
o	Team - total of 7 people max.
o	Domain Experts
o	5 Users

## How to Run
0. Make a hard decision on the problem you're trying to solve, decide on one single problem, focus on being able to invalidate it in 5 days. It is very likely that the Sprint will. Find 5 days when all stakeholders, facilitator and decider are available full-time. [Plan](https://library.gv.com/sprint-week-set-the-stage-99f2f29ce0e7) material, rooms and tools before the sessions begin.
2. [Day 1 - Map](https://library.gv.com/sprint-week-monday-4bf0606b5c81#.c8y9sirq8): The first day is fully dedicated to defining, understanding and modeling the problem space. From clearly outlining the problem we're trying to solve, to mapping the user decision flow, to hearing from multidisciplinary experts that may be involved with the problem, it's designed to give your team a thorough understanding of the problem before agreeing to solve it. The day ends on that agreement, with the team deciding on the Sprint Target.
3. [Day 2 - Sketch](https://library.gv.com/sprint-week-tuesday-d22b30f905c3): The second day is devoted to exploring solutions to the target problem to be solved. It starts with demos of other companies and solutions you believe address the same issue. Then the day becomes about picking up on the insights collected thus far and sketching potential solutions. Everyone will have a chance to silent vote, present their ideas and participate in the selection process. Ultimately, however, the decision is made by the Decider, in a process designed to avoid group-think. This is Day 3.
4. [Day 3 - Decide](https://library.gv.com/sprint-week-wednesday-900fe3f2c26e#.dla3y4wa6): Day 3 is about tapping into the brainpower and cumulative knowledge in the room and making a decision, while attempting to avoid a decision made by persuasion rather than merits (to the degree this is possible). There are a number of techniques proposed to allow people to evaluate and vote on their favourite proposals before they have been pitched, while also allowing people to change their minds once exposed to the thought processes behind each prototype by its creator. The decision may evolve during the day, while combining, selecting and storyboarding the winner(s). The day ends with a full storyboard of the prototype to be tested, which will be built the following day.
5. [Day 4 - Prototype](https://library.gv.com/sprint-week-thursday-df8d7c8c0555): The fourth day is when magic happens and the storyboard evolves into a real, testable version with the appropriate level of fidelity. It's worth noting that teams need to be extremely careful not to overshoot. There's only so much that can be done in a day to create a coherent, testable prototype and it's imperative to focus on the right level of fidelity and then ensuring a coherent story can be built around it. Depending on the skills of the participants, this could range from a paper prototype to an interactive HTML or a sequence of screenshots linked together. The important part is that the interview script and backstory and the prototype form a coherent picture that inverviewees can easily understand and make sense of.
6. [Day 5 - Test](https://library.gv.com/sprint-week-friday-7f66b4194137#.6035fkh04): The final day is when the interviewer performs a user testing session. While preferably they should have done it before, that is not mandatory and there are great insights to be drawn from this session if ego is cast aside and the focus is on the customer's problem, her journey and how the prototype is understood from that point of view.

3. Analyse, consolidate and share results. It is quite likely that the Design Sprint will only be a starting point and further user testing will be necessary before the solution is properly defined. Don't be hesitant to schedule subsequent user testing on revamped prototypes before building. It is an exponentially cheaper process than building something no-one wants or understands.
