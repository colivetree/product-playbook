# Product Increment Sessions

## Intro
To split work into smaller yet meaningful chunks and to use well defined timeframes to deliver work underlies many of the agile methodologies today. It allows teams to focus on delivering value fast but change and adapt when that value hasn't been realised for users and customers. Many start-ups and internet economy companies are now schedulling their major product increments in 4 to 6 week cycles, considered optimal to allow for sufficient scope management by individual teams, while giving organizations the ability to monitor, adapt and pivot if required.

## When to Run
Define your cycle lead time and run at your defined cadence. Experiment with cycle length, ensuring your team has enough time to deliver on their goal in the direction you require them. 6 weeks is considered a good starting point.

## Why to Run
Product Increments are not sprints, they should allow for flexibility, have higher level goals and give freedom of process for teams operating within this framework (e.g. teams can choose to use Kanban, Scrum, XP or any other technique).

## Roles
* Whole product development team

## How to Run
* 1) Have a prioritized list of high-level candidates you need to tackle - see [prioritization](). These should be problem statements or hypotheses that can be validated or invalidated in 6 weeks with an MVP or an increment on the current state of the product.
* 2) Work with the team to develop an understanding of the desired outcome of the 6 weeks. Avoid lists of outputs, think instead of ideal end states, progress you want customers to make in case the problem is solved.
* 3) Choose a definition play, diving into more details of the problem space - see [Defining]().
* 4) In case there are mutiple teams, choose an alignment play to prioritize, select and distribute the work among the teams, making sure there aren't any dependencies, conflicts and execution aligns (whether through cooperation or competition) with the North star metrics at play.
