# Kano Model

## Intro
Applying the Kano Model ((named after professor [Noriaki Kano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noriaki_Kano)) to Understand and Define Customer Needs can tell you a lot about what attributes of your product are essential, superfluous, delightful or just indifferent. It can also tell you when what you're proposing is just plainly the opposite of what customers believe they want. It gives us a practical scoring framework for product characteristics and attributes, which can help prioritize features, remove them from the product or just narrow the team's focus down to what features are most likely to correlate with strong user satisfaction.

## When to Run
When developing a deeper understanding of the product, when trying to fight feature bloat or scope creep, when prioritising between competing functionality, when tailoring the product to a certain cohort of users.

## Why to Run
The Kano Model is an intuitive way to think about customer needs and their satisfaction with the execution of your product (or its current prototype). It provides a measurable way to think about the relationship between customer needs and the feature set you believe your product requires to achieve market fit.

## Roles
* Product Manager / User Researcher
* Surveyed User / Test Group

## How to Run
* 1) Define the set of questions you want to ask your users. These should be stated in relation to the features or ideas you want to put to the test. Phrase each set of questions per feature in 3 ways: Functional, Disfunctional and Impact Scale.
** An example for a bookmarking feature for a video streaming website might be:
*** FUNCTIONAL: If you can bookmark your favourite videos, how do you feel? 1-5 scale, expressed qualitatively. See
*** DISFUNCTIONAL: If you can't bookmark videos, how do you feel?
*** IMPACT SCALE: How important is it or would it be if you could bookmark videos?
* 2) Add any illustrations/prototypes or carefully provide assisting data to your question, which can help the customer visualize what your proposal is. Distribute the survey with any customer feedback tool or simply using Google Forms, SurveyMonkey or Typeform.
* 3) Analyze the results, plot the customers' answers and identify where in the spectrum your features lie and what their relative importance is. Prioritise feature execution or improvement accordingly. A good analysis spreadsheet is provided by Daniel Zacarias, author of Folding Burritos, mentioned below in Tips and Resources.
* 4) Note that users' evaluation of features change over time. In what's commonly called the Decay of Delight effect, it is naturally for initially delightful features to evolve into must-haves (due to natural customer adaptation, competitors copying and making the feature standard and expected, among other reasons).
