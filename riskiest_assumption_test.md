# Riskiest Assumption Test

## Intro
One of the core tenets of the Lean Startup is that business assumptions need to be tested and that an MVP is good mechanism to prove or disprove a hypothesis that could make or break a product. The Riskiest Assumption Test is a framework for categorising and prioritising those assumptions according to the degree of risk/criticality to the product-market fit that they entail.

## When to Run
Whenever a product is in heavy discovery and experimentation mode. Whenever a new initiative or development thread arises and needs validation from a problem, solution or execution point of view. Whenever there are multiple competing priorities in the backlog that seem large enough to make a difference and all fall broadly within the scope of the unique value proposition of a company or product.

## Why to Run
Product-market fit is hard. Assumptions are often wrong to some degree and can miss the mark in terms of customer demand, competitive forces at play, attractiveness, price-point, brand, technical risk or a number of other factors. The Riskiest Assumption Test allows you to identify and clarify what your riskiest assumption is and prioritize your current execution for validating what is currently the biggest potential obstacle in the way of your start-up dreams.

## Roles
* Product Manager

## How to Run
* 1) List your Assumptions, classify them as Problem (is there a market need?), Solution (does this answer that need?) or Execution (is this the best thing we could/should be building to solve it?). These work on a priority order themselves. I.e. If there isn't a problem, there doesn't need to be a solution, if there isn't a solution there doesn't need to be an implementation.
* 2) Formulate them as hypotheses - see [Experimentation](https://github.com/colivetree/product-playbook/blob/master/experimentation.md) for a way to do so.
* 3) Classify their risk. There are 2 standard measures for risk assessment here: Likelihood and Severity, these work in a spectrum. Respectively, they go from "Very Unlikely" <-> "Extremely Likely" and from "Somewhat Annoying" <-> "Idea Killer".
* 4) Prioritise them based on that assessment:
** 4.1) Problems > Solutions > Implementations
** 4.2) Extremely Likely Idea Killers > Very Unlikely Somewhat Annoying Stuff.
* 5) Find a Validation Mechanism for your RAT: A Prototype, A Landing Page, A Sales Pitch, A Survey, A Qualitative Test and many can all be good candidate plays for validating your riskiest assumption.
