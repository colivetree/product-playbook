# Opportunity Solution Tree

## Intro
The Opportunity Solution Tree is an exploration exercise popularised by Teresa Torres that provides a working method for teams looking to solve consumer problems. Teresa recommends teams start by looking at their desired outcome and then connect those outcomes to the Oportunities they have at hand. These should come from research or data and they need to clearly present themselves as means to achieve the desired outcome. Solutions are the next step, and they should also clearly align with each of the Opportunities. If they don't, the team should discard them immediately. Under each proposed solution, teams look at defining experiments that validate their feasibility, viability and desirability, as a means to test their riskiest assumptions.

## When to Run
When considering how to achieve a new goal, when struggling to find a mechanism to tackle a large solution space for a given problem, when building an experimentation backlog to track a stretch goal (like an OKR).

## Why to Run
Going from a goal to a set of actionable items is hard work. Teresa's framework gives Product people the tools to turn these actions into tangible hypotheses that teams can start testing, even in moments of limited information, where they'd have to prioritise opportunities largely based on gut feel.

## Roles
* Product Manager
* Team - bring in as many reference frames as possible (Data, Design, Research, etc.)

## How to Run
1) State your *Desired Outcome* clearly. An example could be: "Users can find the right product in less than 4 taps"
2) Start laying out your *Opportunites*. Look at any data or research insights you may have collected. If you start solutionizing but can't quite put your finger on why (other than gut feeling) that solution solves your desired outcome, try to look at your problem space again, to clarify the opportunity that would require it.
3) Go wide on *Solutions*, ask the team to think laterally and come up with creative ways to solve that same problem. They should clearly align with the *Opportunities* you have identified. If they don't, discard them. At this point your teams should be developing a good notion of what opportunities look the most promising.
4) Rank your *Opportunities* to develop a better notion of where you'd want to start experimenting.
5) Start from the highest ranked opportunities and think of ways to validate your solutions, think about what your riskiest assumptions are. You'll be devising *Experiments* that you could run to ensure, as cheaply as possible, that the opportunity is real, and your solutions resonate with users.
6) Pick your most impactful *Experiments*. Go out and start testing things!
