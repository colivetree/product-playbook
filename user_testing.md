# User Testing Sessions

## Intro
User Testing is a qualitative validation mechanism for your product. It involves talking to prospective customers about their past experiences solving a similar or equivalent problem to that being tested, understanding how they've done it and then getting them to use our solution and talk through their issues, feelings and thoughts while doing so. It helps us answer whether we're solving a real problem, what is wrong with the prototyped approach and how / if it can constitute a replacement to their current resolution to the Job To Be Done.

## When to Run
User Testing sessions are useful since they can be run at a very early stage of fidelity. They allow us to accelerate feedback loops and discover design flaws earlier. They can be run on new features, proposed changes, experiments and even in the main product line to deepen the team's knowledge of how the product is used and what should be launched.

## Why to Run
To get early feedback on an implementation
To understand how and why customers would use your product
To understand how the product allows the customer to make progress and how it fits into their model for problem-solving
To quickly get feedback on what might be preventing customers from making progress with the product

## Roles
* User Researcher
* Product Team

## How to Run
* 1) Identify test to be run, focusing on a particular problem to be solved or job to be done addressed by your solution
* 2) Recruit users who fall into the group of people we believe might be struggling with problem identified
* 3) Have a researcher perform the interview. In smaller teams this might not be feasible, but it is critical that whoever runs the interview can adopt an unbiased stance to focus the interview.
* 4) The researcher / interviewer should follow a script with the questions and list of problems they'd want the subject to test during the session.
* 4) If possible, the team should watch the interviews in a separate room and collect and take notes on the customer's feedback. A simple but effective framework for those notes is to register the customer's background and what he's thinking, feeling and doing while using the product.
* 5) The interviewer should focus the session on the job at hand, how the customer usually solves it, what he'd otherwise do and how they interact with the product. The session should not be focused on hypotheticals such as whether the potential customer would use or pay for the product.
* 6) The interviewee should be encouraged to voice his opinions, thoughts and walk the interviewer through the actions he is taking in a descriptive manner. It's up to the interviewer to steer the conversation in the direction of the problem to be solved when it strays to areas that are not the focus of the current research.
