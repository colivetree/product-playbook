# User Testing Sessions

## Intro
User Testing is a qualitative validation mechanism for your product. It involves talking to prospective customers about their past experiences solving a similar or equivalent problem to that being tested, understanding how they've done it and then getting them to use our solution and talk through their issues, feelings and thoughts while doing so. It helps us answer whether we're solving a real problem, what is wrong with the prototyped approach and how / if it can constitute a replacement to their current resolution to the Job To Be Done.

## When to Run
User Testing sessions are useful since they can be run at a very early stage of fidelity. They allow us to accelerate feedback loops and discover design flaws earlier. They can be run on new features, proposed changes, experiments and even in the main product line to deepen the team's knowledge of how the product is used and what should be launched.

## Why to Run
To get early feedback on an implementation
To understand how and why customers would use your product
To understand how the product allows the customer to make progress and how it fits into their model for problem-solving
To quickly get feedback on what might be preventing customers from making progress with the product
