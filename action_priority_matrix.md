# Action Priority Matrix

## Intro
Using an Action Priority Matrix can be extremely helpful when you are struggling to visualize and prioritize a number of competing initiatives. It creates a hard split between those things that can and should be tackled now (the quick wins), those that you need to understand more about but can be positively disruptive (the moonshots), those that seemed seductive but aren't actually that impactful (the snacks), and those that are definitely not good candidates for the time being and need to be reconsidered (your recycling bin).

## When to Run
Run the action priority matrix when at a crossroads. Consider it when there are a number of potentially impactful activities you could be pursuing, when your team has a very large scope or when you need to clearly communicate what you're expecting to achieve.

## Why to Run
Prioritizing work can be extremely hard, and can feel lonely if done by the Product Manager alone. One way to get people with different frames of reference to contribute (and for them to be invested in decision-making), is to have them in the room when these decisions are made. While ultimately the call should be belong to those responsible for the product position, everyone should be accountable and be able to challenge those decisions. The Action Priority Matrix gets everyone on the same page, by giving them a common framework to think about prioritization and by explicitly leveling the playing field to compare potential solutions using the same dimensions.

## Roles
* Product Team

## How to Run
0) Draw your action priority matrix, with 4 quadrants. Left-to-Right, Top-Down:
* Low Effort / High Impact
* High Effort / High Impact
* Low Effort / Low Impact
* High Effort / Low Impact
1) Ask your team to rank initiatives in the effort scale.
2) Drag your initiatives up/down according to the you think they'll have. (You can reverse 1 and 2, beginning with impact and then asking the team to rate initiatives on effort)
3) Now look at what you have and interpret the 4 quadrants.
* Low Effort / High Impact: No-brainers!
** These initiatives are usually called quick-wins. They're right there for the taking and you can validate them cheaply. If the potential impact is really high, take them immediately. Otherwise, bring them in as you have the chance for some nice gains at low cost.
* High Effort / High Impact: Moonshots
** These are typically your big projects. You have really high hopes for them, but they're super risky. Think of how you can start small and scale them. Nail down what its key tenets are, break them apart and start bringing them to market bit by bit. Reduce your batch size, increase your learning rate and get to the future faster. Big things await!
* Low Effort / Low Impact: Snacks
** These are also called fillers. You bring them into your product cycles because they improve the quality of your product overall, but they're not incredibly significant or impactful. These maintain your performance, but you shouldn't do them at the expense of others.
* High Effort / Low Impact: Recycling
** This is your trouble zone. This is where good teams go to die. These projects will take a large amount of effort for a tiny reward. Re-think them and, if you need to, recycle them. There's a reason you had considered them in the first place, but think about whether there's a different framing you can use for them, or a smaller scope. Think of ways to get them out of this quadrant. If there aren't any, no problem, just ditch them and move on.
