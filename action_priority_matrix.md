## How to Run
0) Draw your action priority matrix, with 4 quadrants. Left-to-Right, Top-Down:
* Low Effort / High Impact
* High Effort / High Impact
* Low Effort / Low Impact
* High Effort / Low Impact
1) Ask your team to rank initiatives in the effort scale.
2) Drag your initiatives up/down according to the you think they'll have.
3) Now look at what you have and interpret the 4 quadrants.
* Low Effort / High Impact: No-brainers!
** These initiatives are usually called quick-wins. They're right there for the taking and you can validate them cheaply. If the potential impact is really high, take them immediately. Otherwise, bring them in as you have the chance for some nice gains at low cost.
* High Effort / High Impact: Moonshots
** These are typically your big projects. You have really high hopes for them, but they're super risky. Think of how you can start small and scale them. Nail down what its key tenets are, break them apart and start bringing them to market bit by bit. Reduce your batch size, increase your learning rate and get to the future faster. Big things await!
* Low Effort / Low Impact: Snacks
** These are also called fillers. You bring them into your product cycles because they improve the quality of your product overall, but they're not incredibly significant or impactful. These maintain your performance, but you shouldn't do them at the expense of others.
* High Effort / Low Impact: Recycling
** This is your trouble zone. This is where good teams go to die. These projects will take a large amount of effort for a tiny reward. Re-think them and, if you need to, recycle them. There's a reason you had considered them in the first place, but think about whether there's a different framing you can use for them, or a smaller scope. Think of ways to get them out of this quadrant. If there aren't any, no problem, just ditch them and move on.
