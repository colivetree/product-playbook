# JTBD Interview

## Intro
A JTBD Interview is one form of user interview meant to surface users' motivation, situational context and demand-side decision parameters involved in a purchasing decision. 
This allows you to generate a model of products fit into users' lives, what they are hired to do, what are the forces that shape adoption (both positive and negative) and how you can build and distribute products that allow customers to make real progress.

## When to Run
This is a session that, like other forms of UXR, can be conducted at any point in order to capture better detail about usage and adoption of your product, understand your role in users' lives and what problems you solve for them, 
but is particularly suited to helping you shape your roadmap, prioritize your company / team-level bets and start shaping your UX to suit key user needs and motivations.

## Why to Run
A set of JTBD interviews allows you to build a solid map of the jobs users hire your product for, which then allows you to build better products, that fit the particulars of peoples' lives.

## Roles
* Interviewer
* Interviewee
* Interviewing Team 

## How to Run
0) The primary goal of a JTBD interview is to discover the primary forces 1) driving the user towards purchase and 2) steering them away from it. The way to map these is to try to reconstruct the user's timeline to buying the product (which can go back years) and understand the compounding effect of these forces in the purchase decision.
1) To reconstruct the timeline, start backwards from the purchase decision and work with the user to reconstruct the various moments that preceded it. 
Don't be afraid to get into the weeds with them. When exactly did they buy it, where they were, who they were with, when did they first learn about it and how, what else they considered, how much did it cost, how did they decide it was worth spending that money, what were they looking for when they bought it, how are they using it.
2) This conversation should paint a clear picture of what 4 types of forces. Push, Pull, Habits and Anxieties. The first two are positive, and compel the user to buy the product. The latter 2 are negative, and drive the user away from it. Mapping these will allow you to uncover the moments, motivations and outcomes users want from the product - hence why they hire it and what for.
3) After the conversation with your user, debrief with the team and categorize your insight into the 4 types of forces described above. Use the format: 
"When I want to..." for pushes, and "so I can..." for pulls. 
4) A lot of teams then try to synthesize and prioritize JTBD via clustering techniques. Some interesting ones are simple euclidian method like the one presented by Ryan Singer, and that contained in Strategyn's Outcome Driven Innovation, or a "simpler" team exercise in synthesis. See the resources below for detail.
