# OKR

## Intro
OKRs are a well-known technique, popularised after Google successfully deployed them across the organisation as a measurable, tangible, Goal-setting exercise. OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results, laying a top-line goal along with a set of supporting quantitative key results that support its successful achievement. They're recognised for their use in setting organisational stretch goals and for providing adequate visibility of goal-setting across an organisation.

## When to Run
When setting goals, typically on large timeframes. Although they can be used for Product Increments and even shorter cycles, they are better at providing direction along Quarterly (or longer) cycles, by setting metrics that move the needle and can typically retain the ability to NOT be wrong for the length of their application.

## Why to Run
Running OKRs provides very clear and tangible objectives for a team and their hierarchical organisational structure guarantees teams realize their connection to the larger organizational progress and executive level goal attainment. They provide directional stretch goals that are hard to obtain and often involve deep problem space exploration, while establishing clear outputs that would move the needle at an organisational / departmental level.

## Roles
* Whole product development team
* Business leadership

## How to Run
* 1) Develop an understanding of the business / department goal that overarches the team's
* 2) Understand as a team what the most impactful initiatives the team can undertake are, that contribute to the goal stated above. Clearly state those initiatives in the form of Objective and Key Results. These answer the questions - "What problem are we solving?" and "How will we know we've solved it?"
* 3) Key Results should  be stretch goals. OKRs should be uncomfortable and feel like they are hard to achieve. As a rule of thumb, achieving 70+% of their stated outcome should be considered a success. More than that they have probably been too humble and less they were probably too ambitious and can be demoralizing.
* 4) Teams should be prepared to defend their OKRs and how they connect to the overarching goal next to business leadership, who are responsible for challenging the OKRs and their impact on the organisation. Ensure OKRs are interpreted correctly as directional guard-rails and can be challenged if they are discovered to be inept or their connection to the higher level OKR is weaker than assumed. The team should reserve a portion of their time for other non-OKR activities as technical debt, discovery exercises and product and engineering broken windows need to be accounted for. Evolving business needs and interactions with other teams' goals discovered during the running cycle should also be addressed during non-OKR time. This should typically be 30-40% of total team time.
