# Metric Pairing

## Intro
One of the common side-effects of focussing on a single metric optimisation is their blindness to context and an inability to account for ripple effects in areas that are just as important. In e-commerce, for example, Conversion Rate is often a paired metric with Total Basket Size, as streamlining the funnel experience can hurt the ability to upsell/xsell. Similarly, Ad CTRs can correlate inversely with Funnel Activation, as driving more users to a funnel with misleading copy can hurt overall product activation and create user renting side-effects. The idea then is to set a primary metric for a given goal, but assign it a paired metric.

## When to Run
In goal-setting exercises, in metric optimisation exercises, scaling and validation plays where there are hidden business side effects that can't be captured by the scope and focus provided by a single metric.

## Why to Run
Because users are multi-dimensional and metrics need to be used as a useful proxy for intended human behaviour. This means that while we can often nudge people in the intended business direction, we need to account for their hidden subversive consequences. We use a balancing, counteracting paired metric to do so in a measurable manner.

## Roles
* Product Management, Data Analysts, Business Leadership

## How to Run
* 1) Define a key metric to optimise for with experiment, feature launch or feature set
* 2) Define counteracting metrics that can be used as a balancing force for the exercise (see resources for some examples)
* 3) Accept improvements in key metrics ONLY IF there's no negative effect on paired metric (i.e. paired is flat or positive)
