# Product Brief

## Intro
Writing a good product brief is a fundamental step to draw a common understanding from a mix of inputs, vision, strategy, constraints and ideas that typically precede product development. It can assume any number of shapes and formats, although some key elements should be present to guarantee there is enough clarity about the outcome or measure of progress we want to achieve, while only providing guardrails in terms of execution.

## When to Run
At the outset of a project or product cycle, when a development team needs to rally behind a common goal and share a mental model of the problem they are trying to solve.

## Why to Run
To write down and have a common reference for what the project is all about. In situations of uncertainty, a shared view is critical to reign back natural fears and uncertainties.

## Roles
* Product Manager - in charge of writing the brief and communication it with the team
* Development team - in charge of peer reviewing, questioning and committing to it.

## How to Run
* 1) Clearly define the "What" - Define the problem you are solving
* 2) Clearly state the "Why" - How do you know that is a real problem
* 3) Define "Success" - How will you know you've solved it
* 4) Lay down the guardrails - What's in scope / out of scope for your next cycle
